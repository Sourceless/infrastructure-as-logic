# Infrastructure as Logic

Model, verify, and synthesize infrastructure with logic-based thinking.

Welcome to the home of **Infrastructure as Logic (IaL)** â€” a new approach to managing infrastructure using logic programming, constraint solving, and goal-directed planning.

## Goals

- Define infrastructure using facts and rules
- Verify invariants and constraints
- Synthesize Terraform-compatible plans from intent
- Build reactive, policy-aware infrastructure systems

## Status

We're currently building the language, tooling, and book.
